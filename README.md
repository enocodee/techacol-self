# Techacol-self
A game combines programming concepts and action RPG (Zelda-like).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The keyword `self` in the game's name means that the game was created using its own engine and the engine is still under development as a toy project, so this version is unstable.
>
> A stable version is intended to implement in the future. `self` keyword will be removed if this version is intended as a release version, all information will be updated later.
